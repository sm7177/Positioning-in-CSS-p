    <h1>Hornets</h1>
    
    <div id="hor">
        Hornets (insects in the genus Vespa) are the largest of the eusocial wasps, and are similar in appearance to
        yellowjackets, their close relatives. Some species can reach up to 5.5 cm (2.2 in) in length. They are
        distinguished from other vespine wasps by the relatively large top margin of the head. Worldwide, 22 species of
        Vespa are recognized. Most species only occur in the tropics of Asia, though the European hornet (V.
        crabro) is widely distributed throughout Europe, Russia, North America, and north-eastern Asia. Wasps native to
        North America in the genus Dolichovespula are commonly referred to as hornets (e.g., baldfaced hornets), but all
        of them are actually yellowjackets.
        <br><br>
        Like other social wasps, hornets build communal nests by chewing wood to make a papery pulp. Each nest has one
        queen, which lays eggs and is attended by workers that, while genetically female, cannot lay fertile eggs. Most
        species make exposed nests in trees and shrubs, but some (such as Vespa orientalis) build their nests
        underground or in other cavities. In the tropics, these nests may last year-round, but in temperate areas, the
        nest dies over the winter, with lone queens hibernating in leaf litter or other insulative material until the
        spring. Male hornets are docile and do not have stingers.
        <br><br>
        Hornets are often considered pests, as they aggressively guard their nesting sites when threatened and their
        stings can be more dangerous than those of bees.
        <br><br>
        While taxonomically well defined, some confusion may remain about the differences between hornets and other
        wasps of the family Vespidae, specifically the yellowjackets, which are members of the same subfamily. Also, a
        related genus of Asian nocturnal vespines, Provespa, is referred to as "night wasps" or "night hornets",
        though they are not true hornets.

        Some other large wasps are sometimes referred to as hornets, most notably the bald-faced hornet (Dolichovespula
        maculata) found in North America. It is set apart by its black and ivory coloration. The name "hornet" is used
        for this species primarily because of its habit of making aerial nests (similar to some of the true hornets)
        rather than subterranean nests. Another example is the Australian hornet (Abispa ephippium), which is actually a
        species of potter wasp.
        <br>
        Hornets are found mainly in the Northern Hemisphere. The European hornet (V. crabro) is the best-known species,
        widely distributed in Europe (but is never found north of the 63rd parallel), and European Russia (except in
        extreme northern areas). In the east, the species' distribution area stretches over the Ural Mountains to
        western Siberia (found in the vicinity of Khanty-Mansiysk). In Asia, the European hornet is found in southern
        Siberia, as well as in eastern China. The European hornet was accidentally introduced to eastern North America
        about the middle of the 19th century and has lived there since at about the same latitudes as in Europe.
        However, it has never been found in western North America.
        <br><br>
        The Asian giant hornet (V. mandarinia) lives in the Primorsky Krai, Khabarovsky Krai (southern part), and Jewish
        Autonomous Oblast regions of Russia, and China, Korea, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Indochina, India, Nepal,
        Sri Lanka, and Thailand, but is most commonly found in the mountains of Japan, where they are commonly known as
        the giant sparrow bee.
        <br><br>
        The Oriental hornet (V. orientalis) occurs in semidry, subtropical areas of central Asia (Azerbaijan, Armenia,
        Dagestan in Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, Oman, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,
        Kyrghyzstan, southern Kazakhstan), and southern Europe (Italy, Malta, Albania, Romania, Turkey, Greece,
        Bulgaria, Cyprus).
        <br><br>
        The Asian hornet (V. velutina) has been introduced to France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and the United Kingdom.
